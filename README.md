# What are the Agriculture Impacts of Flash Droughts in Illinois?

by: Dr. Pedro Alencar & Dr. Trent Ford

You may have heard the term “flash drought” recently. A flash drought is a type of drought that develops and intensifies more quickly than a conventional drought. For example, much of central and western Illinois went from no drought in mid-May to severe or extreme drought in June this year. 

Flash drought is thought to cause worse impacts to agriculture because of its rapid development and relatively little time for preparation. However, flash droughts are challenging to identify, predict, and study. Therefore, the impacts specific to flash drought are not well understood and may be misrepresented in research.
